## Phase 3: Staging Deployment, Logging & Monitoring (Week 3)

**Goal:** Deploy to staging, and establish comprehensive logging and monitoring.

1.  **Skaffold Configuration for Staging Profile:**
    * Add a `staging` profile to `skaffold.yaml`.
    * Configure deployment to a dedicated GKE staging namespace with preview URLs.
    * **Tooling:** Skaffold

2.  **CI/CD Pipeline for Staging Environment:**
    * Extend the CI/CD pipeline to include automated deployments to the staging environment.

    * **Tooling:** GitLab CI / Cloud Build / ArgoCD

3.  **Cloud Logging and Monitoring Setup:**
    * Enable Cloud Logging for all GKE clusters and associated GCP services.
    * Create custom dashboards in Cloud Monitoring to visualize key metrics (e.g., latency, error rate, CPU, memory).
    * Set up basic alerts for critical system metrics.
    * **Tooling:** GCP Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring

4.  **Prometheus/Grafana Integration:**
    * Integrate Prometheus and Grafana via GKE add-ons or Helm charts for in-depth application and infrastructure monitoring.
    * Create application-specific dashboards in Grafana.
    * **Tooling:** Prometheus, Grafana, Helm

5.  **Log Streaming:**
    * Configure log sinks to stream logs to Cloud Storage or BigQuery for long-term analysis and auditing.
    * **Tooling:** GCP Cloud Logging

## Phase 4: Production Deployment & Autoscaling (Week 4)

**Goal:** Deploy to production with robust autoscaling and reliability features.

1.  **Skaffold Configuration for Prod Profile:**
    * Add a `prod` profile to `skaffold.yaml`.
    * Configure deployment with stricter policies, canary rollouts, and monitoring hooks.
    * **Tooling:** Skaffold

2.  **CI/CD Pipeline for Production Environment:**
    * Extend the CI/CD pipeline for production deployments, incorporating approval gates and canary deployment strategies.
    * Automate Skaffold profile selection based on Git branch (e.g., `main` branch deploys to production).
    * **Tooling:** GitLab CI / Cloud Build / ArgoCD

3.  **Advanced Alerting:**
    * Set up comprehensive alerts for business logic, integration errors, and failures.
    * Configure notification channels (e.g., PagerDuty, Slack, email).

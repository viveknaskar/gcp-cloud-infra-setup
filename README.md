# Project Specification: GCP Infrastructure Setup for High-Traffic Service

## Project Overview

This project sets up a scalable, secure, and observable infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) tailored for high-traffic services. It includes complete IaC provisioning with Terraform, GKE-based workloads, CI/CD pipelines using Skaffold, and integrated monitoring/logging.
 
**Goal**: Deploy and manage multi-environment infrastructure with autoscaling, security, and observability best practices.

## Project Scope

### 1. Cloud Infrastructure (GCP)
- Provision VPC, subnets, NAT, firewalls, and Cloud DNS.
- Multi-zone GKE cluster deployment.
- IAM configuration, secrets management, and Cloud Armor setup.
- HTTPS ingress via Cloud Load Balancer (with optional Cloud CDN).
- Infrastructure defined using Terraform (IaC).

### 2. Application Architecture
- **API Server**: Stateless REST/GraphQL service with autoscaling (HPA).
- **AI Server**: Model inference engine with support for multiple models.
- **Backend Server**: Central coordinator with persistent storage (if needed).
- **Databases**:
  - Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL) with private IP, HA, and backups.
  - InfluxDB (via Helm) with Cloud Storage support.
  - Temporal (stateful service) with internal LoadBalancer and worker pools.

**Networking**:
- Internal service discovery via Istio/Kubernetes Services.
- External traffic routed through Cloud Load Balancer to the API Server only.

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline & Skaffold Profiles
- CI/CD using GitLab CI, Cloud Build, or ArgoCD.
- Skaffold profiles for:
  - **Dev**: Fast iteration, port-forwarding.
  - **Staging**: GKE namespace deployment with preview URLs.
  - **Prod**: Canary rollouts, stricter policy, monitoring hooks.
- Auto profile selection based on Git branch or environment variables.

### 4. Logging & Monitoring
- Cloud Logging & Monitoring with custom dashboards.
- Prometheus/Grafana integration (via Helm or GKE add-ons).
- Alerts:
  - CPU, memory, error rates, latency.
  - Business logic or integration failures.
- Log streaming to Cloud Storage/BigQuery.

### 5. Scaling & Reliability
- Horizontal Pod Autoscalers with custom/built-in metrics.
- GKE Cluster Autoscaler enabled.
- PodDisruptionBudgets, health checks, anti-affinity rules for resilience.
- Multi-zone failover and DR planning/testing.

## Deliverables

- Terraform codebase for full infra provisioning.
- Skaffold configuration for multi-environment deployment.
- CI/CD pipeline scripts with Skaffold integration.
- Dashboards and alert rules for Grafana/Cloud Monitoring.
- Documentation: architecture diagram, runbooks, access policies.
